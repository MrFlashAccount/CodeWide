This file is combined with notices discovered from the exact WebView bundle
inputs by `scripts/write-third-party-notices.mjs`. Bundle generation fails when
a distributed package has no readable license file.

## JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono

The Android terminal bundles `JetBrainsMonoNerdFontMono-Regular.ttf` from
Nerd Fonts 3.4.0. It combines JetBrains Mono with the Nerd Fonts glyph set so
terminal text, Powerline separators, and icons share one monospaced grid.

JetBrains Mono and this patched font are distributed under the SIL Open Font
License 1.1. The complete license is bundled at
`licenses/jetbrains-mono-nerd-font/OFL.txt`.
